The Idea Behind Sizers</h1>
<p>The layout algorithm used by sizers in wxWidgets is closely related to layout systems in other GUI toolkits, such as Java's AWT, the GTK toolkit or the Qt toolkit. It is based upon the idea of individual subwindows reporting their minimal required size and their ability to get stretched if the size of the parent window has changed. This will most often mean that the programmer does not set the start-up size of a dialog, the dialog will rather be assigned a sizer and this sizer will be queried about the recommended size. This sizer in turn will query its children (which can be normal windows, empty space or other sizers) so that a hierarchy of sizers can be constructed. Note that <a class="el" href="classwx_sizer.html" title="wxSizer is the abstract base class used for laying out subwindows in a window. ">wxSizer</a> does not derive from <a class="el" href="classwx_window.html" title="wxWindow is the base class for all windows and represents any visible object on screen. ">wxWindow</a> and thus does not interfere with tab ordering and requires very few resources compared to a real window on screen.</p>
<p>What makes sizers so well fitted for use in wxWidgets is the fact that every control reports its own minimal size and the algorithm can handle differences in font sizes or different window (dialog item) sizes on different platforms without problems. For example, if the standard font as well as the overall design of Linux/GTK widgets requires more space than on Windows, the initial dialog size will automatically be bigger on Linux/GTK than on Windows.</p>
<p>There are currently seven different kinds of sizers available in wxWidgets. Each represents either a certain way to lay out dialog items in a dialog or it fulfills a special task such as wrapping a static box around a dialog item (or another sizer). These sizers will be discussed one by one in the text below. For more detailed information on how to use sizers programmatically, please refer to the section <a class="el" href="overview_sizer.html#overview_sizer_box">wxBoxSizer</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="overview_sizer_features"></a>
Common Features</h1>
<p>All sizers are containers, that is, they are used to lay out one dialog item (or several dialog items), which they contain. Such items are sometimes referred to as the children of the sizer. Independent of how the individual sizers lay out their children, all children have certain features in common:</p>
<p><b>A minimal size</b>: This minimal size is usually identical to the initial size of the controls and may either be set explicitly in the <a class="el" href="classwx_size.html" title="A wxSize is a useful data structure for graphics operations. ">wxSize</a> field of the control constructor or may be calculated by wxWidgets, typically by setting the height and/or the width of the item to -1. Note that only some controls can calculate their size (such as a checkbox) whereas others (such as a listbox) don't have any natural width or height and thus require an explicit size. Some controls can calculate their height, but not their width (e.g. a single line text control):</p>

</div>
<div class="image">
<img src="overview_sizer_05.png" alt="overview_sizer_05.png"/>
</div>
<p><b>A border</b>: The border is just empty space and is used to separate dialog items in a dialog. This border can either be all around, or at any combination of sides such as only above and below the control. The thickness of this border must be set explicitly, typically 5 points. The following samples show dialogs with only one dialog item (a button) and a border of 0, 5, and 10 pixels around the button:</p>

</div>
<div class="image">
<img src="overview_sizer_02.png" alt="overview_sizer_02.png"/>
</div>
<p><b>An alignment</b>: Often, a dialog item is given more space than its minimal size plus its border. Depending on what flags are used for the respective dialog item, the dialog item can be made to fill out the available space entirely, i.e. it will grow to a size larger than the minimal size, or it will be moved to either the centre of the available space or to either side of the space. The following sample shows a listbox and three buttons in a horizontal box sizer; one button is centred, one is aligned at the top, one is aligned at the bottom:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="overview_sizer_06.png" alt="overview_sizer_06.png"/>
</div>
<p><b>A stretch factor</b>: If a sizer contains more than one child and it is offered more space than its children and their borders need, the question arises how to distribute the surplus space among the children. For this purpose, a stretch factor may be assigned to each child, where the default value of <code>0</code> indicates that the child will not get more space than its requested minimum size. A value of more than zero is interpreted in relation to the sum of all stretch factors in the children of the respective sizer, i.e. if two children get a stretch factor of <code>1</code>, they will get half the extra space each <em>independent of whether one control has a minimal sizer inferior to the other or not</em>. The following sample shows a dialog with three buttons, the first one has a stretch factor of <code>1</code> and thus gets stretched, whereas the other two buttons have a stretch factor of <code>0</code> and keep their initial width:</p>

Hiding Controls Using Sizers</h1>
<p>You can hide controls contained in sizers the same way you would hide any control, using the <a class="el" href="classwx_window.html#a7fbc92ce240a8d4f6956b6e0276ef07f" title="Shows or hides the window. ">wxWindow::Show()</a> method. However, <a class="el" href="classwx_sizer.html" title="wxSizer is the abstract base class used for laying out subwindows in a window. ">wxSizer</a> also offers a separate method which can tell the sizer not to consider that control in its size calculations. To hide a window using the sizer, call <a class="el" href="classwx_sizer.html#afb6638468fe2253d1870b4d387c57a0b" title="Shows or hides the window. ">wxSizer::Show()</a>. You must then call Layout on the sizer to force an update.</p>
<p>This is useful when hiding parts of the interface, since you can avoid removing the controls from the sizer and having to add them back later.</p>

wxBoxSizer</h1>
<p><a class="el" href="classwx_box_sizer.html" title="The basic idea behind a box sizer is that windows will most often be laid out in rather simple basic ...">wxBoxSizer</a> can lay out its children either vertically or horizontally, depending on what flag is being used in its constructor. When using a vertical sizer, each child can be centered, aligned to the right or aligned to the left. Correspondingly, when using a horizontal sizer, each child can be centered, aligned at the bottom or aligned at the top. The stretch factor described in the last paragraph is used for the main orientation, i.e. when using a horizontal box sizer, the stretch factor determines how much the child can be stretched horizontally. The following sample shows the same dialog as in the last sample, only the box sizer is a vertical box sizer now:</p>

The width of each column and the height of each row are calculated individually according to the minimal requirements from the respectively biggest child. Additionally, columns and rows can be declared to be stretchable if the sizer is assigned a size different from the one it requested. The following sample shows the same dialog as the one above, but using a flex grid sizer:</p>

Programming with wxBoxSizer</h1>
<p>The basic idea behind a <a class="el" href="classwx_box_sizer.html" title="The basic idea behind a box sizer is that windows will most often be laid out in rather simple basic ...">wxBoxSizer</a> is that windows will most often be laid out in rather simple basic geometry, typically in a row or a column or several hierarchies of either.</p>
<p>As an example, we will construct a dialog that will contain a text field at the top and two buttons at the bottom. This can be seen as a top-hierarchy column with the text at the top and buttons at the bottom and a low-hierarchy row with an OK button to the left and a Cancel button to the right. In many cases (particularly dialogs under Unix and normal frames) the main window will be resizable by the user and this change of size will have to get propagated to its children. In our case, we want the text area to grow with the dialog, whereas the button shall have a fixed size. In addition, there will be a thin border around all controls to make the dialog look nice and - to make matter worse - the buttons shall be centred as the width of the dialog changes.</p>
<p>It is the unique feature of a box sizer, that it can grow in both directions (height and width) but can distribute its growth in the main direction (horizontal for a row) <em>unevenly</em> among its children. In our example case, the vertical sizer is supposed to propagate all its height changes to only the text area, not to the button area. This is determined by the <em>proportion</em> parameter when adding a window (or another sizer) to a sizer. It is interpreted as a weight factor, i.e. it can be zero, indicating that the window may not be resized at all, or above zero. If several windows have a value above zero, the value is interpreted relative to the sum of all weight factors of the sizer, so when adding two windows with a value of <code>1</code>, they will both get resized equally much and each half as much as the sizer owning them. Then what do we do when a column sizer changes its width? This behaviour is controlled by <em>flags</em> (the second parameter of the Add() function): Zero or no flag indicates that the window will preserve it is original size, <code>wxGROW</code> flag (same as <code>wxEXPAND</code>) forces the window to grow with the sizer, and <code>wxSHAPED</code> flag tells the window to change it is size proportionally, preserving original aspect ratio. When <code>wxGROW</code> flag is not used, the item can be aligned within available space. <code>wxALIGN_LEFT</code>, <code>wxALIGN_TOP</code>, <code>wxALIGN_RIGHT</code>, <code>wxALIGN_BOTTOM</code>, <code>wxALIGN_CENTER_HORIZONTAL</code> and <code>wxALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL</code> do what they say. <code>wxALIGN_CENTRE</code> (same as <code>wxALIGN_CENTER</code>) is defined as (<code>wxALIGN_CENTER_HORIZONTAL | wxALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL</code>). Default alignment is <code>wxALIGN_LEFT | wxALIGN_TOP</code>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, any window belonging to a sizer may have a border, and it can be specified which of the four sides may have this border, using the <code>wxTOP</code>, <code>wxLEFT</code>, <code>wxRIGHT</code> and <code>wxBOTTOM</code> constants or wxALL for all directions (and you may also use <code>wxNORTH</code>, <code>wxWEST</code> etc instead). These flags can be used in combination with the alignment flags above as the second parameter of the Add() method using the binary <code>or</code> operator <code></code>|. The sizer of the border also must be made known, and it is the third parameter in the Add() method. This means, that the entire behaviour of a sizer and its children can be controlled by the three parameters of the Add() method.</p>
