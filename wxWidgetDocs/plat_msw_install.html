<h1><a class="anchor" id="msw_install"></a>
Installation                           </h1>
<p>If you are using one of the supported compilers, you can use <a class="el" href="plat_msw_binaries.html">pre-built binaries</a>.</p>
<p>In this case, just uncompress the binaries archive under any directory and skip to <a href="#msw_build_apps">Building Applications Using wxWidgets</a> part.</p>
<p>Otherwise, or if you want to build a configuration of the library different from the default one, you need to build the library from sources before using it.</p>
<p>If you use CMake, please see <a class="el" href="overview_cmake.html">CMake Overview</a> for building wxWidgets using it.</p>
<p>The first step, which you may have already performed, unless you are reading this file online, is to download the source archive and uncompress it in any directory. It is strongly advised to avoid using spaces in the name of this directory, i.e. notably do <em>not</em> choose a location under "C:\Program Files", as this risks creating problems with makefiles and other command-line tools.</p>
<p>After choosing the directory location, please define WXWIN environment variable containing the full path to this directory. While this is not actually required, this makes using the library more convenient and this environment variable is used in the examples below.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="msw_update_setup_h"></a>
Upgrading Existing Git Checkout         </h2>
<p>If you checked your sources from version control repository and didn't obtain them from a release file, you may need to update your <code>include/wx/msw/setup.h</code> file to add any new options from <code>include/wx/msw/setup0.h</code> to it. If you hadn't edited <code>setup.h</code> file manually, you can just delete it to force recreating it by copying <code>setup0.h</code> to <code>setup.h</code> during the next build. If you forget to do it, you may get errors during the build due to new options being undefined.</p>
<p>If you have no intention of ever modifying <code>setup.h</code>, you may avoid this problem entirely by creating a symbolic link to <code>setup0.h</code> before building, e.g. using mklink, from an admin command prompt: </p><pre class="fragment">cd %WXWIN%\include\wx\msw\
mklink setup.h setup0.h
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="msw_build"></a>
Building wxWidgets                     </h1>
<p>The following sections explain how to compile wxWidgets with each supported compiler, see the "Building Applications" section about the instructions for building your application using wxWidgets.</p>
<p>All makefiles and project are located in build directory.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="msw_build_msvs"></a>
Microsoft Visual C++ Compilation       </h2>
<ul>
<li>From command line using the provided makefiles:</li>
</ul>
<p>0. Open a "Visual Studio Command Prompt" window shortcut to which must have been installed to the "Start" menu or the "Start" screen by MSVS installation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p class="startli">Change directory to %WXWIN% and type </p><pre class="fragment"> &gt; nmake /f makefile.vc
</pre><p class="startli">to build wxWidgets in the default debug configuration as a static library. You can also do </p><pre class="fragment"> &gt; nmake /f makefile.vc BUILD=release
</pre><p class="startli">to build a release version or </p><pre class="fragment"> &gt; nmake /f makefile.vc BUILD=release SHARED=1 TARGET_CPU=X86
</pre><p class="startli">to build a 32 bit release DLL version from an x86 command prompt, or </p><pre class="fragment"> &gt; nmake /f makefile.vc BUILD=release SHARED=1 TARGET_CPU=X64
</pre><p class="startli">to build a 64 bit release DLL version from an x64 command prompt.</p>
<p class="startli">See "Configuring the Build" for more information about the additional parameters that can be specified on the command line.</p>
</li>
<li>To verify your build, change the directory to %WXWIN% and run the same nmake command (with the same parameters there), this should create a working minimal wxWidgets sample.</li>
<li>If you need to rebuild, use "clean" target first or "nmake /a".</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>From the IDE using the provided project files:</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to use project files are provided for VC++ versions 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16 (also known as MSVS 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019 respectively).</p>
<p>Simply open <code>wx_vcN.sln</code> (for N=7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 or 16) file, select the appropriate configuration (Debug or Release, static or DLL) and build the solution. Notice that when building a DLL configuration, you may need to perform the build several times because the projects are not always built in the correct order, and this may result in link errors. Simply do the build again, up to 3 times, to fix this.</p>
<h3>Special notes for Visual Studio 2010+</h3>
<p>For Visual Studio 2010+ solutions it is possible to customize the build by creating a <code>wx_local.props</code> file in the build directory which is used, if it exists, by the projects. The settings in that file override the default values for the properties such as wxCfg (corresponding to the CFG makefile variable described below) or wxVendor (corresponding to VENDOR). The typical way to make the file is to copy <code>wx_setup.props</code> to <code>wx_local.props</code> and then edit local.</p>
<p>For example, if you are building wxWidgets libraries using multiple versions of Visual Studio you could change wxCompilerPrefix to include the toolset: </p><pre class="fragment">-    &lt;wxCompilerPrefix&gt;vc&lt;/wxCompilerPrefix&gt;
+    &lt;wxCompilerPrefix&gt;vc$(PlatformToolsetVersion)&lt;/wxCompilerPrefix&gt;
</pre><p>Following that example if you are using Visual Studio 2013 and open <code>wx_vc12.sln</code> it will build using the "vc120" prefix for the build directories so to allow its build files to coexist with the files produced by the other MSVC versions.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that by using a separate local props file you ensure that your changes won't be lost when updating to a future wxWidgets version. But if <code>wx_setup.props</code> is updated in some later commit your <code>wx_local.props</code> is not updated with it. For example the version information in <code>wx_setup.props</code> could change and the information in your <code>wx_local.props</code> would be outdated. It is your responsibility to monitor for such situations.</p>
<h3>Improve debugging for Visual Studio 2012+</h3>
<p>Debug visualizers for Visual Studio 2012+ are provided which makes inspecting various wxWidgets classes easier to view while debugging. To use them:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the folder %WXWIN%</li>
<li>Open the folder %USERPROFILE% Documents Studio 2012\ (or the corresponding location for newer versions, e.g. ...2013)</li>
<li>Copy wxWidgets.natvis and autoexp.inc</li>
<li>For Visual Studio 2013+ additionally copy wxWidgets.2013.natvis</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="msw_build_cygwin"></a>
Cygwin/MinGW Compilation               </h2>
<p>wxWidgets supports Cygwin, MinGW, MinGW-w64 and TDM-GCC tool chains under Windows. They can be downloaded from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mingw.org/">http://www.mingw.org/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/">http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/">http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/</a></p>
<p>respectively. Please retrieve and install the latest version of your preferred tool chain by following the instructions provided by these packages. Notice that Cygwin includes both native Cygwin compiler, which produces binaries that require Cygwin during run-time, and MinGW[-w64] cross-compilers which can still be used in Cygwin environment themselves but produce plain Windows binaries without any special run-time requirements. You will probably want to use the latter for developing your applications.</p>
<p>If using MinGW, you can download the add-on MSYS package to provide Unix-like tools that you'll need to build wxWidgets using configure.</p>
<p>C++11 note: If you want to compile wxWidgets in C++11 mode, you currently have to use -std=gnu++11 switch as -std=c++11 disables some extensions that wxWidgets relies on. I.e. please use CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11".</p>
<p>All of these tool chains can be used either with Unix-like configure+make build process (preferred) or with the provided makefile.gcc makefiles without using configure:</p>
<h3>Using configure</h3>
<p>This method works in exactly the same way as under Unix systems, including OS X, and requires a Unix-like environment to work, i.e. either MSYS or Cygwin.</p>
<p>0. Open MSYS or Cygwin shell prompt.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a build directory: it is is strongly recommended to not build the library in the directory containing the sources (<code>$WXWIN</code>) but to create a separate build directory instead. The build directory can be placed anywhere (using the fastest available disk may be a good idea), but in this example we create it as a subdirectory of the source one: <pre class="fragment"> $ cd $WXWIN
 $ mkdir build-debug
 $ cd build-debug
</pre></li>
<li>Run configure passing it any of the options shown by "configure
   --help". Notice that configure builds shared libraries by default, use &ndash;disable-shared to build static ones. For example: <pre class="fragment"> $ ../configure --enable-debug
</pre></li>
<li>Build the library: <pre class="fragment"> $ make
</pre></li>
<li>Test the library build by building the minimal sample: <pre class="fragment"> $ cd samples/minimal
 $ make
</pre></li>
<li><p class="startli">Optionally install the library in a global location </p><pre class="fragment"> $ make install
</pre><p class="startli">Notice that there is not much benefice to installing under Windows so this step can usually be omitted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Using plain makefiles:</h3>
<p>NOTE: The makefile.gcc makefiles are for compilation under MinGW using Windows command interpreter (command.com/cmd.exe), they won't work if you use Unix shell, as is the case with MSYS. Follow the instructions for using configure above instead if you prefer to use Unix shell.</p>
<p>0. Open DOS command line window (cmd.exe, <em>not</em> Bash sh.exe).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p class="startli">Change directory to %WXWIN% and type </p><pre class="fragment"> &gt; mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc
</pre><p class="startli">to build wxWidgets in the default debug configuration as a static library. Add "BUILD=release" and/or "SHARED=1" to build the library in release configuration and/or as a shared library instead of the default static one.</p>
<p class="startli">NOTE: For parallel builds, i.e. using -jN make option, please run <code>mingw32-make -jN ... setup_h</code> first and then rerun the full make command without <code>setup_h</code> at the end to work around a bug in the current makefiles.</p>
</li>
<li>To verify your build, change the directory to samples and run the same mingw32-make command (with the same parameters there), this should create a working minimal wxWidgets sample.</li>
<li>If you need to rebuild, use "clean" target first.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="msw_build_borland"></a>
Borland C++ Compilation                </h2>
<p>WARNING: Borland instructions are out of date, please send us your corrections if you are using it with wxWidgets 3.0.</p>
<p>The minimum version required is 5.5 (last version supported by BC++ 5.0 was 2.4.2), which can be downloaded for free from: <a href="http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html">http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html</a></p>
<p>We have found that the free Turbo Explorer and commercial BDS work fine; the debugger is very good. To avoid linker errors you will need to add -DSHARED=1 to the makefile line for the library</p>
<p>The version 5.6 included in Borland C++ Builder 2006 works as well after the following small change: please remove the test for <code>__WINDOWS__</code> from line 88 of the file <code>BCCDIR\include\stl\_threads.h</code>.</p>
<p>Compiling using the makefiles:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Change directory to build. Type 'make -f makefile.bcc' to make the wxWidgets core library. Ignore the compiler warnings. This produces a couple of libraries in the <code>lib\bcc_lib</code> directory.</li>
<li>Change directory to a sample or demo such as samples, and type <code>make -f makefile.bcc</code>. This produces a windows exe file - by default in the <code>bcc_mswd</code> subdirectory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note (1): the wxWidgets makefiles assume dword structure alignment. Please make sure that your own project or makefile settings use the same alignment, or you could experience mysterious crashes. To change the alignment, change CPPFLAGS in build\msw\config.bcc.</p>
<p>Note (2): If you wish debug messages to be sent to the console in debug mode, edit makefile.bcc and change /aa to /Tpe in link commands.</p>
<h2>Using the Debugger and IDE in BDS or Turbo Explorer </h2>
<p>Double-click / open %WXWIN%.bdsproj. The current version is to be used with a dynamic build of wxWidgets-made by running make -f Makefile.bcc -DBUILD=debug -DSHARED=1 in wxWidgets. You also need the <code>wxWidgets\lib\bcc_dll</code> directory in your PATH. The debugger tracks your source and also traces into the wxWidgets sources.</p>
<p>To use this to debug other samples, copy the <code>borland_ide.cpp</code> and borland.bdsproj files, then replace all occurrences of "minimal" with the name of the new project files</p>
<p>Compilation succeeds with CBuilderX personal edition and CBuilder6, but you may have to copy make.exe from the 5.5 download to the new bin directory.</p>
<p>Compiling using the IDE files for Borland C++ 5.0 and using CBuilder IDE (v1-v6): not supported</p>
<p>** REMEMBER ** In all of your wxWidgets applications, your source code should include the following preprocessor directive: </p><pre class="fragment">#ifdef __BORLANDC__
#pragma hdrstop
#endif
</pre><p>(check the samples &ndash; e.g., .cpp &ndash; for more details)</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="msw_install_and_build"></a>
Installing and building wxWidgets using vcpkg         </h1>
<p>You can download and install wxWidgets using the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg">vcpkg</a> dependency manager: </p><pre class="fragment">&gt; git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
&gt; cd vcpkg
&gt; bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
&gt; vcpkg integrate install
&gt; vcpkg install wxwidgets
</pre><p>The wxWidgets port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg">create an issue or pull request</a> on the vcpkg repository.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="msw_build_config"></a>
Configuring the Build                  </h1>
<p>NOTE: If you use configure to build the library with Cygwin/MinGW, the contents of this section does not apply, just pass the arguments to configure directly in this case.</p>
<h2>Library configuration </h2>
<p>While it is never necessary to do it, you may want to change some of the options in the %WXWIN%\include\wx\msw\setup.h file before building wxWidgets. This file is heavily commented, please read it and enable or disable the features you would like to compile wxWidgets with[out].</p>
<p>Notice that this file is later copied into a directory under lib for each of the build configurations which allows to have different build options for different configurations too if you edit any configuration-specific file.</p>
<h2>Makefile parameters </h2>
<p>When building using makefiles, you can specify many build settings (unlike when using the project files where you are limited to choosing just the configuration and platform). This can be done either by passing the values as arguments when invoking make or by editing <code>build\msw\config.$compiler</code> file where <code>$compiler</code> is the same extension as the makefile you use has (see below). The latter is good for setting options that never change in your development process (e.g. <code>GCC_VERSION</code> or <code>VENDOR</code>). If you want to build several versions of wxWidgets and use them side by side, the former method is better. Settings in <code>config.*</code> files are shared by all makefiles (including the samples), but if you pass the options as arguments, you must use the same arguments you used for the library when building samples!</p>
<p>For example, to build the library in release mode you can either change the "BUILD" variable definition in <code>build\msw\config.$compiler</code> or use </p><pre class="fragment">    &gt; nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug
    &gt; mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc BUILD=debug
</pre><p>depending on the compiler used.</p>
<p>The full list of the build settings follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli"><code>BUILD=release</code></p>
<p class="startli">Builds release version of the library. It differs from default 'debug' in lack of appended 'd' in name of library and uses the release CRT libraries instead of debug ones. Notice that even release builds do include debug information by default, see <code>DEBUG_FLAG</code> for more information about it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>SHARED=1</code></p>
<p class="startli">Build shared libraries (DLLs). By default, DLLs are not built (SHARED=0).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>UNICODE=0</code></p>
<p class="startli">To completely disable Unicode support (default is UNICODE=1). It should not be necessary to do this.</p>
<p class="startli">This option affect name of the library ('u' is appended in the default Unicode build) and the directory where the library and setup.h are stored (ditto).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>WXUNIV=1</code></p>
<p class="startli">Build wxUniversal instead of native wxMSW</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>MONOLITHIC=1</code></p>
<p class="startli">Starting with version 2.5.1, wxWidgets has the ability to be built as several smaller libraries instead of single big one as used to be the case in 2.4 and older versions. This is called "multilib build" and is the default behaviour of makefiles. You can still build single library ("monolithic build") by setting MONOLITHIC variable to 1.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>USE_GUI=0</code></p>
<p class="startli">Disable building GUI parts of the library, build only wxBase components used by console applications. Note that if you leave <code>USE_GUI=1</code> then both wxBase and GUI libraries are built.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>USE_$LIBRARY=0</code></p>
<p class="startli">Do not build the corresponding library (all libraries are built by default). Library which can be disabled in this way are: AUI, HTML, MEDIA, GL (the option name is <code>USE_OPENGL</code> for this one), PROPGRID, QA, RIBBON, RICHTEXT, STC, WEBVIEW, XRC.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>RUNTIME_LIBS=static</code></p>
<p class="startli">Links static version of C and C++ runtime libraries into the executable, so that the program does not depend on DLLs provided with the compiler (e.g. Visual C++'s msvcrt.dll or Borland's cc3250mt.dll). Caution: Do not use static runtime libraries when building DLL (SHARED=1)!</p>
</li>
<li><code>DEBUG_FLAG=0</code></li>
<li><code>DEBUG_FLAG=1</code></li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>DEBUG_FLAG=2</code></p>
<p class="startli">Specifies the level of debug support in wxWidgets. Notice that this is independent from both BUILD and <code>DEBUG_INFO</code> options. By default always set to 1 meaning that debug support is enabled: asserts are compiled into the code (they are inactive by default in release builds of the application but can be enabled), <a class="el" href="group__group__funcmacro__log.html#ga9c530ae20eb423744f90874d2c97d02b" title="The right functions for debug output. ">wxLogDebug()</a> and <a class="el" href="group__group__funcmacro__log.html#ga947e317db477914c12b13c4534867ec9" title="Log a message at wxLOG_Trace log level (see wxLogLevelValues enum). ">wxLogTrace()</a> are available and <code>__WXDEBUG__</code> is defined. Setting it to 0 completely disables all debugging code in wxWidgets while setting it to 2 enables even the time consuming assertions and checks which are deemed to be unsuitable for production environment.</p>
</li>
<li><code>DEBUG_INFO=0</code></li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>DEBUG_INFO=1</code></p>
<p class="startli">This option affects whether debugging information is generated. If omitted or set to 'default' its value is determined the value of the BUILD option.</p>
</li>
<li><code>DEBUG_RUNTIME_LIBS=0</code></li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>DEBUG_RUNTIME_LIBS=1</code></p>
<p class="startli">(VC++ only.) If set to 1, msvcrtd.dll is used, if to 0, msvcrt.dll is used. By default msvcrtd.dll is used only if the executable contains debug info and msvcrt.dll if it doesn't. It is sometimes desirable to build with debug info and still link against msvcrt.dll (e.g. when you want to ship the app to customers and still have usable .pdb files with debug information) and this setting makes it possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>TARGET_CPU=X64|ARM64|IA64</code></p>
<p class="startli">(VC++ only.) Set this variable to build for x86_64 systems. If unset, x86 build is performed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>VENDOR=&lt;your company name&gt;</code></p>
<p class="startli">Set this to a short string identifying your company if you are planning to distribute wxWidgets DLLs with your application. Default value is 'custom'. This string is included as part of DLL name. wxWidgets DLLs contain compiler name, version information and vendor name in them. For example <code>wxmsw311u_core_vc_custom.dll</code> is one of DLLs build using Visual C++ with default settings. If you set VENDOR=mycorp, the name will change to <code>wxmsw311u_core_vc_mycorp.dll.</code></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>CFG=&lt;configuration name&gt;</code></p>
<p class="startli">Sets configuration name so that you can have multiple wxWidgets builds with different setup.h settings coexisting in same tree. The value of this option is appended to the build directories names. This is useful for building the library in some non-default configuration, e.g. you could change <code>wxUSE_STL</code> to 1 in <code>\WXWIN\%\include\wx\msw\setup.h</code> and then build with <code>CFG=-stl</code>. Alternatively, you could build with e.g. <code>RUNTIME_LIBS=static CFG=-mt</code> when using MSVC.</p>

Building Applications Using wxWidgets  </h1>
<p>If you use MSVS 2010 or later IDE for building your project, simply add <code>wxwidgets.props</code> property sheet to (all) your project(s) using wxWidgets by using "View|Property Manager" menu item to open the property manager window and then selecting "Add Existing Property Sheet..." from the context menu in this window.</p>
<p>If you've created a new empty project (i.e. chose "Empty Project" in the "Create a new project" window shown by MSVS rather than "Windows Desktop"), you need to change "Linker|System|SubSystem" in the project properties to "Windows", from the default "Console". You don't need to do anything else.</p>
<p>If you want to use CMake for building your project, please see <a class="el" href="overview_cmake.html">CMake Overview</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise follow the instructions below for "manual" setup of your project.</p>
<p>We suppose that wxWidgets sources are under the directory <code>$WXWIN</code> (notice that different tool chains refer to environment variables such as WXWIN in different ways, e.g. MSVC users should use <code>$</code><code>(WXWIN)</code> instead of just <code>$WXWIN</code>). And we will use <code>&lt;wx-lib-dir&gt;</code> as a shortcut for the subdirectory of <code>$WXWIN\lib</code> which is composed from several parts separated by underscore: first, a compiler-specific prefix (e.g. "vc" for MSVC, "gcc" for g++ or the value of <code>COMPILER_PREFIX</code> if you set it explicitly), then optional "x64" if building in 64 bits and finally either "lib" or "dll" depending on whether static or dynamic wx libraries are being used.</p>
<p>For example, WXWIN could be "c:\wxWidgets\3.4.5" and <code>&lt;wx-lib-dir&gt;</code> could be <code>c:\wxWidgets\3.4.5\lib\vc_x64_lib</code> for 64-bit static libraries built with MSVC.</p>
<p>Here is what you need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>$WXWIN\include</code> to the<ul>
<li>compiler</li>
<li>resource compiler include paths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If using MSVC, prepend <code>$WXWIN\include\msvc</code> to the include paths too. Otherwise, append <code>&lt;wx-lib-dir&gt;\mswu[d]</code> to the include paths, where "d" should be used for debug builds only.</li>
<li>Define the following symbols for the preprocessor:<ul>
<li><code>__WXMSW__</code> to ensure you use the correct wxWidgets port.</li>
<li><code>_UNICODE</code> unless you want to use deprecated ANSI build of wxWidgets.</li>
<li><code>NDEBUG</code> if you want to build in release mode, i.e. disable asserts.</li>
<li><code>WXUSINGDLL</code> if you are using DLL build of wxWidgets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If using MSVC 7 only (i.e. not for later versions), also define <code>wxUSE_RC_MANIFEST=1</code> and <code>WX_CPU_X86</code>.</li>
<li>Add <code>&lt;wx-lib-dir&gt;</code> directory described above to the libraries path.</li>
</ul>
<p>When using MSVC, the libraries are linked automatically using "#pragma
comment(lib)" feature of this compiler. With all the other compilers you also need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the list of libraries to link with to the linker input. The exact list depends on which libraries you use and whether you built wxWidgets in monolithic or default multlib mode and basically should include all the relevant libraries from the directory above, e.g. `wxmsw31ud_core.lib wxbase31ud.lib wxtiffd.lib wxjpegd.lib wxpngd.lib wxzlibd.lib wxregexud.lib wxexpatd.lib` for a debug build of an application using the core library only (all wxWidgets applications use the base library).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, please notice that the makefiles and project files provided with wxWidgets samples show which flags should be used when building applications using wxWidgets and always work, so in case of a problem, e.g. if the instructions here are out of date, you can always simply copy a makefile or project file from <code>$WXWIN\samples\minimal</code> or some other sample and adapt it to your application.</p>
